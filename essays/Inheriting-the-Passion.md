## Passing the torch?

  Being as young as I can remember, I was given an old gameboy. Who's gameboy was given to me? It was my dad's gameboy that he gave to me when
I was younger. My mom and dad are split, I live with my mom here on Oahu and visit my father on Maui everynow and then. So each 
vacation I went to visit my dad had a lot of videogames involved. After recieving my first hand-held console, I was filled with 
joy from the games I played. Such gaming led to me bonding with my dad and looking up to him. He graduated with BS in Computer Science 
on Maui. As I get to see my dad more and learn about him doing programming and working with computers, I began to gain interest in 
those topics as well. 

## Keeping the flames alive

  As I grew older, I kept playing more games with my dad. It led from the hand-held consoles to consoles like the XBOX and then to my 
personally 
built PC. Once I learned that coding can create videogames, I wanted to be a programmer for videogames. Although, I didn't have any idea 
how to study programming pre-college and the only experience I got was HTML and working with Scratch. Once I started to play more games 
on my computer, I decided to builf my own PC. Asking my dad for advice, I managed to look up parts and build it when I flew back home.
Thus began my interest in actual programming.

## Euphoria from programming and the present

  Once I started college and actually got my first programming class, I was nervous to see if I would like programming or not. But as I 
progressed through the class I began to really like programming and thinking of solutions to the problem. Programming was a class that 
therapuetic as I typed multiple lines of code and seeing my programs compile and work. Now I am in a software engineering class to
hopefully
further develop my skills as a programmer. My goals for the future are to get into the Pookela program for the state and become a state 
worker.
