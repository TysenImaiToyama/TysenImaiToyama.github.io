## Question Etiquette

  Similar to how we have etiquette when interacting with each other in person, there is also etiquette for interactions online as well.
To efficiently gain answers to your questions, one must ask "smart" questions. As mentioned by Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen, there are 
things you can do before attempting to ask your question and efficient ways to go about asking your question. Before asking a question, 
you can attempt to find the answer by searching the forums, web, manual, FAQ, experiments, source code or asking a skilled friend to help.
When those actions do not lead you to your answer then you will have to use an efficient way to ask questions. Such ways are to choose a
related forum, ask technical questions, and not asking homework questions.

This question is very descriptive of the problem. It seems to be a very unique question as there are not questions similar to it. The 
symptoms of the problem are discussed and it does not seem to be a question answered by the manual as well. The question is also concise 
and to the point. Snippets of the code is pasted rather than the whole code.
