## Clean Your Room! Er, I Mean Code!

Would you invite strangers to your room if it was as messy as a pigsty? If no, then the same should apply to messy code you make. Eventually someone is going to look through your code or collaborate with you when pursuing a career in programming. Often times, in a way to be considerate, you should have good coding standards to help another person easily read through your code. Messy code and lower coding standards can cause confusion setbacks in projects. You may argue that ugly code gives job security but that debilitates any help from another developer or hinders any further development of code and maintaining it. High coding standards will allow yourself to be utilized in any team environment. Any confusing styles will slow down the progression in the project. I believe having high coding standards is useful to not only your collaborators but yourself as well.

## My Coding Standards
Developing your coding standards in a high and proper standards can help you learn the language or syntax of a language. After using eslint in Intellij, I found no hassle in coding. As a programmer, I believe that its important to have clean code because when bugs arise, there is a huge pain in the ass to look through ugly code to find the bugs. After using eslint in Intellij, I found it useful to help clean my code into being readable or functionable. Also when learning code for the first time, good coding standards help you understand code blocks and how to read functions and statements within functions. Not using proper curly brackets or indentation within code makes it harder to see nested statements or functions and can cause confusion. Its just my mindset after learning coding to make my code as clean as possible so when I have to revise or implement it with other people, it will be easy to read and understand. You will write thousands of line of code for single projects and you will thank yourself for using high coding standards when a bug comes up or a revision needs to be made. I can Such minor sounding things in code play a vital role for people learning and creating code because of its ability to make code readable.
