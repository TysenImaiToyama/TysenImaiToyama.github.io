## Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UH-Clubr is an app that holds a directory of clubs within UH Manoa. These clubs are either official or organizations. This app has the ability filter clubs in different categories to a person's taste and display a clubs information for users to look through and decide on a club to join. In hopes to help students liven up their campus experience, UH-Clubr will help find a club or organization to fit the user's preferences.

## Contributions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did the landing page, except the text in the middle and after a user is logged in. I created the logo through a logo website called [Logojoy](https://logojoy.com/?gspk=ZWxsYWNsYXJr&gsxid=Czmx5itmOQGa&utm_source=growsumo). The NavBar was also done by me in which I made it so that the menu items appear depending on who is signed in. Weirdly, the sign out, sign up and log in do not redirect after successful submissions from the template. I made it so that the sign out will redirect through a tick timer function after a few seconds. Sign ups will redirect to a make a profile page and the sign up on the landing disappears when a user is logged in. I also finished the footer for a simple look. A lot of the redirecting functionality was done by me. The filter function was also contributed by me.
