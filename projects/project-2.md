  In life people are going to need help eventually and I get a happy high when helping people. This tutoring job has taught me how to 
professionally interact with people and not on a casual level. Tutoring has made me have to find multiple approaches in tutoring people.
It was a anyone can come inside math lab, which meant I had different types of people at varying levels of math. I learned that people need different approaches of learning and that relatable topics that are applied to math help a lot. There has been critical thinking and developing various ways to explain a problem within this job.

  I contributed to this tutoring job for 2 semesters before leaving to my current job at Koolau Ballrooms and Conference center. I have passed down my knowledge in math to hopefully future world changers in the science department. Even before I worked as a tutor I contributed to helping other people instead of working on my Calculus homework. I hope to be aple to apply my experience with explaining programs to customers and teammates/classmates who need help. This experience is more unique than my food industry jobs as a sushi maker or pantry chef because my product to be sold is my own knowledge and how I am able to translate that knowledge into something they can understand.
